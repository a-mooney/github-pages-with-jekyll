Hello World! 
This is my first post and I'm just testing out this page right now. I hope to have real content up soon. 
For now, I'll just keep testing things out and learning more about Github. 
I have used Github for a while on a separate work account, but none of it is public. 
Additionally, that account is used more for Project Management type tasks, and not a strong representation of my capabilities in data analytics. 
Join me as I enhance and further develop this page to really show of my data and coding skills!
Thanks for stopping by.
